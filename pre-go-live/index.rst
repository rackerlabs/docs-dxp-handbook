======================
Pre-go-live activities
======================

Before you go live with your application, you work with the RAS Digital
Experience team to:

* Establish your implementation objectives and timeline
* Identify the applications and transactions that you want to monitor
* Define alerts
* Write a runbook that outlines the actions that the RAS Digital Experience
  team takes when a an alert is triggered

Your work in the pre-go-live phase of your implementation ensures that
your go-live date is not delayed and that you transition smoothly
into the post-go-live phase of your project.
